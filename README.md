# 8051 Simulator

A basic **Intel 8051 microcontroller simulator**. This project aims to emulate
the 8051 CPU architecture at the register and instruction level â€” purely in software,
just for fun and educational purposes.

## Features (in progress)

- Modular design
- Emulated CPU core with registers
- Simple memory and I/O model
- Cross-platform (Windows & Linux)
- Unit tests via Catch2

## About

This project is a learning-oriented 8051 emulator written in modern C++23,
leveraging modules to represent each hardware block (CPU, Memory, IO).
The ultimate goal is to create a real, byte-accurate simulation of the original Intel 8051.
